In order to give you control over your own data, we use a file upload/download process to allow you to edit your application. This means that instead of saving your application to a server, whenever you're ready to take a break or submit a final copy, we'll ask you to download a file. When you're ready to continue on, you can simply upload the same file back into the tool and all your information will magically appear.</p>
